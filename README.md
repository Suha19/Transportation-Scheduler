# Transportation-Scheduler

#Instructions:

In this assignment, I created a flights schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various flights, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
